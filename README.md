 As a proposed idea, we would suggest a website that manages a equipment rental system for Student Senate, as they just implemented a new program that allows students to rent various items of equipment, such as hammocks, frisbees, volleyballs, etc.
            When you navigate to the website, the first page you see would contain text fields that would record information like name, ID #, phone number, and email address. Once the user hits a “Next” button, the existing input form would be replaced with a new form that contains a dropdown for what the user is renting. It would also include a field where the date your rental would be needed (i.e MM/DD/YYYY) is entered, and the time you need the rental (i.e 3:30 PM). This would then be sent to a server that logs the record of the rental, and then keeps track of it in some sort of database.
	The last page would contain a thank you message (i.e. “Thank you for your rental. Your request has been recorded.”) and a message that explains an email notification will be sent to the user for their rental. Meanwhile, an administrator from the student senate will periodically check the database for new input and prepare the equipment as requested, using the inputted data.
It wouldn’t exactly be a complex interface, but it would eliminate the need for a paper form that is kept in a binder, like it is currently. Making the process electronic would speed it up and make it less messy, and allow people to rent things without having to come to the Senate office just to register to rent.
